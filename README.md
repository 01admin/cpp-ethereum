# FORMER HOME OF ETHEREUM C++ CLIENT

The C++ codebase was split into multiple repositories in October 2015.  They are all gathered as git sub-modules under the [webthree-umbrella](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/).

Ethereum Homestead Documentation can be found at http://docs.ethereum.org/.

The Ethereum C++ Wiki can be found at https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki.

There is a [plan to re-consolidate]([https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/251) the repositories following Homestead, which should make the structure of the codebase much easier to understand.
