# FORMER HOME OF ETHEREUM C++ CLIENT

The C++ codebase was split into multiple repositories in October 2015.

They are all gathered as git sub-modules under [the webthree-umbrella repo](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/).

There is a [plan to re-consolidate]([https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/251) the repositories following Homestead, which should make the structure of the codebase much easier to understand.

Significant effort was put into new [Ethereum Documentation](http://docs.ethereum.org/) for Homestead in March 2016.

There is also an [Ethereum C++ Wiki](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/wiki), which will probably be consolidated into the main documentation in the near future.
