# Former home of Ethereum C++ client

The C++ codebase was split into multiple repositories in October 2015.

They are all gathered as git sub-modules under
[the webthree-umbrella repo](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/).

There is a [plan to re-consolidate](https://github.com/ethereum/webthree-umbrella/issues/251)
the repositories following Homestead, which should make the structure of the codebase much
easier to understand.

Significant effort was put into new
[Ethereum C++ Documentation](http://docs.ethereum.org/en/latest/ethereum-clients/cpp-ethereum/)
for the [Homestead release](https://blog.ethereum.org/2016/02/29/homestead-release/)
in March 2016.
